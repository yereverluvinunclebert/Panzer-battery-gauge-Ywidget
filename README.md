# Panzer-battery-gauge-Ywidget

Dieselpunk Desktop Battery widget, written in Javascript and XML for the Yahoo 
Widget (Konfabulator) Engine. Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 8, 10+ as well as the 
Apple Mac.

A Dieselpunk Battery widget. - I created for the World of Tanks and War Thunder 
communities.This Panzer widget is a simple Battery strength gauge. Functional 
and gorgeous at the same time as long as you have a battery. The graphics are my 
own, I took original inspiration from a clock face by Italo Fortana.

To find out how the widget operates, simply right click and select Help and a 
full explanation of all the buttons, windows is shown. The top left window is 
the current power in digital form. Hovering over any control should supply a 
pop-up explaining each function.

Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget 
will cause a personalised Windows application to fire up. The first time you run 
it there will be no assigned function and so it will state as such and then pop 
up the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget 
takes command line-style commands for windows. 

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.
